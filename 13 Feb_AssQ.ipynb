    "Q.6> List down the best practices for Exception hadling in python .\n",

    "\n",
    "     Be specific: Use specific exception classes whenever possible, rather than catching \n",
    "     and handling all exceptions with a single generic except block. This allows you to \n",
    "     handle different types of errors in different ways and provides more detailed error \n",
    "     messages to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Keep it simple: Use simple and concise try-except blocks that focus on the specific \n",
    "    error being handled. Avoid overcomplicating exception handling by nesting multiple \n",
    "    try-except blocks or using complex exception hierarchies.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Don't ignore exceptions: Avoid ignoring exceptions by using an empty except block or \n",
    "    catching a broad range of exceptions with a generic except block. This can hide underlying \n",
    "    problems and make it difficult to debug issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use finally blocks: Use finally blocks to ensure that cleanup code is executed, regardless \n",
    "    of whether an exception was raised or not. This can be useful for releasing resources, \n",
    "    closing files, or cleaning up temporary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Raise exceptions when appropriate: Raise exceptions when it makes sense to do so, rather \n",
    "    than relying solely on error codes or return values. This can provide more detailed \n",
    "    information about the error and allow for better error handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Log exceptions: Use logging to log exceptions and other error-related information. This \n",
    "    can be useful for debugging issues and identifying patterns of errors."
